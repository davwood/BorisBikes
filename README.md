BorisBikes
==========

An exercise at learning object orientated programming at Makers Academy - Week 3.
This was done using ruby.

The aim was to create a simple system for London boris bikes. You could:

 - Check in a bike to a station
 - Check out a bike
 - Break a bike
 - Fix a bike
 - And ride bikes between stations

Tests are with Rspec
